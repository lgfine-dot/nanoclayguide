faq:
  - question: "Does nanoclay count as a nanomaterial under EU rules?"
    answer: "It depends on the particle size distribution. Under EU Recommendation 2011/696/EU, a material qualifies as a nanomaterial if 50% or more of particles (by number) have at least one external dimension between 1–100 nm. The platelet thickness of exfoliated montmorillonite (~1 nm) meets this criterion, but many commercial nanoclay products are agglomerated stacks (tactoids) well above 100 nm. REACH registration and the EU Cosmetics Regulation treat nanomaterials separately, so you must characterize your specific grade. Ask your supplier for a particle size distribution by number (not volume) using TEM or AF4-MALS."
  - question: "What is the difference between bentonite and montmorillonite?"
    answer: "Bentonite is a rock — a naturally occurring clay deposit composed predominantly of montmorillonite but also containing quartz, feldspar, cristobalite, and other minerals. Montmorillonite is a specific mineral within the smectite group, defined by its 2:1 layered silicate structure with octahedral aluminum substitutions. When suppliers say 'bentonite' they usually mean unrefined or lightly processed clay; 'montmorillonite' or 'nanoclay' typically implies a purified grade with higher smectite content (>90%). For technical applications, always ask for the montmorillonite purity percentage and the specific cation exchange capacity (CEC)."
  - question: "How do I specify organoclay modifier loading?"
    answer: "Organoclay modifier loading is specified as milliequivalents of organic cation per 100 grams of dry clay (meq/100g), expressed relative to the clay's cation exchange capacity (CEC). A '1× CEC' loading means stoichiometric replacement of all exchangeable cations. Common commercial products range from 0.8× to 1.4× CEC. Higher loadings (>1× CEC) include excess surfactant adsorbed on external surfaces, which increases d-spacing but can affect thermal stability. When specifying, state: (1) the modifier chemistry (e.g., dimethyl dihydrogenated tallow ammonium), (2) the target loading as a fraction of CEC, and (3) the required d-spacing measured by XRD. Verify with TGA — organic content should match the theoretical value within ±2%."
  - question: "What tests predict nanoclay performance best?"
    answer: "The most informative tests depend on your application, but a practical core panel includes: (1) XRD — d-spacing confirms intercalation/exfoliation state and modifier presence; (2) TGA — quantifies organic modifier content and thermal stability onset; (3) CEC — cation exchange capacity (methylene blue or ammonium acetate method) indicates ion exchange potential; (4) BET surface area — higher values generally correlate with better dispersion potential; (5) Particle size distribution — laser diffraction for agglomerates, TEM for individual platelets. For polymer nanocomposites, add rheology (melt viscosity increase correlates with exfoliation) and TEM of the final compound. For barrier applications, add oxygen transmission rate (OTR) testing on finished films."
  - question: "Is nanoclay safe? What about dust exposure?"
    answer: "Natural nanoclays (unmodified montmorillonite, halloysite, kaolinite) have a long history of safe use in food contact, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. They are generally regarded as low-toxicity materials. However, respirable dust is a concern in any fine-powder handling environment. Crystalline silica (quartz) contamination in poorly purified grades poses the primary inhalation risk — always check the quartz content on your supplier's SDS. For organically modified clays, the quaternary ammonium surfactants add aquatic toxicity and skin irritation concerns. Standard precautions: use local exhaust ventilation, wear P2/N95 masks when handling dry powder, and keep workplace dust below the occupational exposure limit (typically 2–10 mg/m³ for inhalable dust, jurisdiction-dependent). Store in sealed containers to prevent moisture uptake and dusting."

<div class="faq-answer">

Organoclay modifier loading is specified as milliequivalents of organic cation per 100 grams of dry clay (meq/100g), expressed relative to the clay's cation exchange capacity (CEC). A "1&times; CEC" loading means stoichiometric replacement of all exchangeable cations. Common commercial products range from 0.8&times; to 1.4&times; CEC.
