"Which nanoclay should I use?" is the most common question we hear from engineers evaluating these materials for the first time. The answer depends entirely on your matrix chemistry, processing conditions, and performance targets — but you can narrow the field quickly once you understand how the major types differ.

This article compares the five nanoclay families you'll encounter commercially: sodium montmorillonite, organically modified montmorillonite, halloysite nanotubes, kaolinite, and sepiolite/palygorskite. We'll cover structure, key properties, pricing, and application fit for each.

## The quick comparison

Before the detail, here's the overview:

| Property | Na-MMT | Organoclay (OMMT) | Halloysite | Kaolinite | Sepiolite |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Morphology** | Platelet (2:1) | Platelet (2:1) | Nanotube | Platelet (1:1) | Needle/fiber |
| **Nano dimension** | ~1 nm thick | ~1 nm thick | ~50 nm OD, 15 nm ID | ~7 nm thick | ~20–30 nm diameter |
| **Aspect ratio** | 100–500 | 100–500 | 10–50 (L/D) | 5–20 | 20–100 (L/D) |
| **CEC (meq/100g)** | 80–120 | N/A (sites occupied) | 6–10 | 1–5 | 20–35 |
| **BET (m²/g)** | 250–400 | 200–350 | 50–70 | 10–30 | 150–320 |
| **d-spacing** | ~1.2 nm | 1.8–4.0 nm | 0.72 nm (fixed) | 0.72 nm (fixed) | N/A (fibrous) |
| **Hydrophilic?** | Yes | No | Mildly | Yes | Yes |
| **Thermal limit** | >500°C | 180–250°C | >400°C | >450°C | >400°C |
| **Price ($/kg)** | 1–5 | 5–50 | 5–15 | 0.50–2 | 2–8 |

<!--
FLAG FOR REVIEW: BET values for Na-MMT (250–400) represent purified grades. Lower-purity commercial products may report 30–80 m²/g. Halloysite BET of 50–70 m²/g is typical for Dragonite/PATCH products; some literature reports up to 100 m²/g for acid-etched grades. Verify against your supplier data. Sepiolite BET range is broad — Pangel grades (Tolsa) may differ from generic. Kaolinite CEC of 1–5 meq/100g is for well-crystallized grades; disordered kaolinites can reach 10–15 meq/100g.

Now let's look at each type in detail.

## Sodium montmorillonite (Na-MMT)

### What it is

The unmodified, purified form of montmorillonite with sodium as the dominant interlayer cation. This is the **base material** from which organoclays are made, but it's also a product in its own right.

### Structure and properties

Na-MMT has a **2:1 layered silicate structure**: two tetrahedral silica sheets sandwiching one octahedral alumina sheet. Each platelet is approximately 1 nm thick and 100–500 nm in lateral dimensions. Platelets stack into tactoids with a basal spacing of ~1.2 nm (the XRD signature you'll see on every datasheet).

The key property of Na-MMT is its **high cation exchange capacity** — typically 80–120 meq/100g. This means a large population of exchangeable sodium ions sitting between the platelets, which gives the material its water swelling, thixotropy, and capacity for organic modification.

Na-MMT is **strongly hydrophilic**. In water, it swells to 10–15 times its dry volume as water molecules intercalate between the platelets. This makes it excellent for aqueous systems but fundamentally incompatible with hydrophobic polymers in its unmodified form. If you try to compound Na-MMT directly into polyethylene or polypropylene, you'll get poor dispersion and minimal property improvement.

### Where it fits

- **Water-based systems** — rheology modification in paints, coatings, drilling fluids, cosmetics
- **Paper and paperboard** — barrier coatings (applied from aqueous dispersion)
- **Latex nanocomposites** — direct addition to latex emulsions before film formation
- **Adsorbent applications** — heavy metal removal, wastewater treatment
- **Feedstock for organoclay production** — the starting material for the next category

### Pricing

**$1–5/kg** depending on purity and source. Wyoming-origin Na-bentonite with >90% montmorillonite content sits at the higher end. Lower-purity grades from Indian or Chinese deposits can be under $1/kg in bulk.

## Organically modified montmorillonite (OMMT)

### What it is

Na-MMT with the sodium interlayer cations **exchanged for quaternary ammonium surfactants**. This is the workhorse nanoclay for polymer nanocomposites and the type most people mean when they say "nanoclay" in a materials engineering context.

### Structure and properties

The organic modifier pushes the platelets apart, increasing d-spacing from 1.2 nm to **1.8–4.0 nm** depending on the modifier chain length and loading. The modifier tails also render the platelet surfaces hydrophobic, making them compatible with organic polymer matrices.

The thermal stability ceiling is set by the **organic modifier, not the clay**. Quaternary ammonium salts begin to decompose at **180–250°C** (the onset temperature depends on the specific modifier chemistry — hydrogenated tallow quats are more stable than shorter-chain alternatives). This is the primary processing constraint: if your melt compounding temperature exceeds the modifier's degradation onset, you'll lose performance and can generate discoloration, odor, and volatile byproducts.

The organic modifier typically accounts for **25–45% of the product weight** (measurable by TGA). This means when you buy a kilogram of organoclay, you're getting 550–750 grams of actual clay mineral plus 250–450 grams of surfactant. Keep this in mind when comparing loading levels across products — 5 wt% of a heavily modified organoclay delivers less mineral content than 5 wt% of a lightly modified one.

### Modifier chemistry matters

Not all organoclays are interchangeable. The modifier determines compatibility:

**Dimethyl dihydrogenated tallow ammonium (2M2HT)** — The most common modifier. Two long alkyl chains (C16–C18 from hydrogenated tallow fat). Best compatibility with non-polar polymers: polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene. d-spacing typically 2.4–3.5 nm.

**Methyl tallow bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ammonium (MT2EtOH)** — One tallow chain plus two hydroxyethyl groups, making it more polar. Better compatibility with nylon, polyurethane, and other polar polymers. d-spacing typically 1.8–2.2 nm.

**Dimethyl benzyl hydrogenated tallow ammonium** — One tallow chain plus a benzyl group. Bridges the gap between polar and non-polar systems. Used in polystyrene, some polyesters, and epoxy systems.

Choosing the wrong modifier for your polymer is one of the most common mistakes in nanoclay formulation. A non-polar organoclay in a polar matrix (or vice versa) will give poor intercalation and negligible property improvement regardless of how well you process it.

### Where it fits

- **Polymer nanocomposites** — the primary application. PP, PE, nylon, PET, epoxy, polyurethane
- **Coatings and adhesives** — rheology modification, sag resistance, barrier improvement
- **Flame retardant synergist** — reduces peak heat release rate in combination with conventional FR additives
- **Packaging films** — gas barrier improvement (OTR reduction) at low loading

### Pricing

**$5–50/kg** with most commercial grades falling in the $10–25/kg range. Premium pricing reflects purity of the base clay, modifier quality, and washing thoroughness. The cheapest organoclays often have high free surfactant content and inconsistent d-spacing.

## Halloysite nanotubes (HNT)

### What it is

A completely different clay mineral from montmorillonite. Halloysite is a **1:1 aluminosilicate** (one tetrahedral sheet + one octahedral sheet) that naturally rolls into **hollow nanotubes** due to a lattice mismatch between its two layers.

### Structure and properties

Halloysite tubes are typically **300–1,500 nm long**, with an **outer diameter of 40–70 nm** and an **inner lumen of 10–20 nm**. The aspect ratio (length ÷ diameter) is much lower than montmorillonite's — typically **10–50** compared to montmorillonite's 100–500.

The hollow lumen is halloysite's unique feature. It can be loaded with active agents — corrosion inhibitors, antimicrobials, flame retardants, drugs — and released over time. This makes halloysite a **natural nanoscale container**, a property that montmorillonite cannot match.

Halloysite's CEC is very low (**6–10 meq/100g**) compared to montmorillonite. This means less capacity for organic modification, but it also means halloysite disperses more easily in polymer matrices without modification — it doesn't have the strong platelet-to-platelet electrostatic attraction that makes montmorillonite tactoids hard to separate.

Thermal stability is good: halloysite is stable to **>400°C** without organic modification to worry about.

### Where it fits

- **Controlled release** — corrosion inhibitor delivery in coatings, antimicrobial delivery in packaging, drug delivery in pharma
- **Mechanical reinforcement** — moderate stiffness improvement at 5–10 wt% loading; less effective per-weight than exfoliated MMT but easier to disperse
- **Nucleating agent** — accelerates crystallization in semi-crystalline polymers (PP, PLA)
- **Ceramic and catalysis** — the tubular structure provides porosity and active sites

### Key limitation

Halloysite cannot match montmorillonite for **barrier improvement**. Gas barrier depends on platelet aspect ratio — flat, high-aspect-ratio platelets create a tortuous diffusion path. Tubes don't do this effectively. If barrier is your primary target, halloysite is the wrong choice.

### Pricing

**$5–15/kg** for commercial grades. The primary commercial source has historically been the Dragonite deposit in Utah (now owned by Applied Minerals/I-Minerals), though deposits in New Zealand, Turkey, and China also supply the market.

<!--
FLAG FOR REVIEW: Applied Minerals Inc. went through financial difficulties and corporate changes. Verify the current commercial status of the Dragonite deposit and whether I-Minerals is the correct current entity. Other halloysite sources include Northland (NZ) and various Chinese suppliers. The New Zealand deposit (IMERYS) may be the primary source now.

## Kaolinite

### What it is

A **1:1 layered aluminosilicate** — structurally related to halloysite but in its flat (non-tubular) form. Kaolinite is the world's most abundantly mined clay mineral, but only a tiny fraction of production is used in "nano" applications.

### Structure and properties

Kaolinite platelets are thicker than montmorillonite — approximately **7 nm per layer** — with lower aspect ratios (typically 5–20). The layers are held together by **hydrogen bonding** between the silica face of one layer and the alumina face of the next, which is much stronger than the electrostatic forces in montmorillonite. This makes kaolinite much harder to exfoliate.

CEC is very low (**1–5 meq/100g**), meaning minimal capacity for cation exchange or organic modification. BET surface area is also low (10–30 m²/g) because the platelets don't separate easily.

### Where it fits

Kaolinite is primarily used as a **bulk filler** (paper coating, ceramics, paint extender) rather than a performance nanomaterial. Its relevance to the nanoclay conversation is mostly as a point of comparison — when someone offers you a low-priced "nanoclay," verify it's not simply fine-ground kaolinite, which will not deliver the same property improvements as montmorillonite.

That said, **nano-kaolinite** (produced by intensive delamination and exfoliation) is an active area of research for applications where montmorillonite's high CEC and swelling are undesirable — for example, as a filler in rubber compounds where dimensional stability matters more than barrier properties.

### Pricing

**$0.50–2/kg** — by far the cheapest clay mineral. This price reflects abundant supply and minimal processing, not performance equivalence with montmorillonite or halloysite.

## Sepiolite and palygorskite

### What they are

**Fibrous clay minerals** with a needle-like morphology rather than plates or tubes. Sepiolite and palygorskite (also called attapulgite) are magnesium-rich silicates with internal channels running along the fiber length.

### Structure and properties

Sepiolite fibers are typically **200–2,000 nm long** and **20–30 nm in diameter**, giving an aspect ratio of 10–100. The internal channel structure gives sepiolite a surprisingly high **BET surface area (150–320 m²/g)** despite the relatively large fiber diameter.

Unlike montmorillonite, sepiolite does not swell in water and does not have expandable interlayers. Its rheological properties come from fiber-to-fiber entanglement and hydrogen bonding, not from platelet swelling.

### Where it fits

- **Rheology modification** — thixotropic thickening in paints, sealants, and adhesives, especially in systems where montmorillonite's moisture sensitivity is a problem
- **Thermal insulation** — microporous insulation boards
- **Cat litter and absorbents** — the largest volume application by far
- **Polymer reinforcement** — moderate reinforcement with easier dispersion than MMT (no tactoid delamination needed)

### Key advantage over MMT

Sepiolite doesn't require organic modification for polymer compatibility. The fibers disperse individually without needing to overcome tactoid attraction. This simplifies processing and eliminates the thermal stability ceiling imposed by organic modifiers. For applications above **220°C processing temperature**, sepiolite may be a better option than OMMT simply because there's no modifier to degrade.

### Pricing

**$2–8/kg** for purified grades. Major producers include Tolsa (Spain — Pangel brand), BASF (via acquired assets), and various Turkish suppliers.

## How to choose: a decision framework

Rather than memorizing the comparison table, use these three questions to narrow the field:

### 1. What is your matrix?

- **Aqueous system** (water-based coating, latex, slurry) → Na-MMT
- **Non-polar polymer** (PE, PP, PS) → OMMT with non-polar modifier (2M2HT)
- **Polar polymer** (nylon, PU, epoxy) → OMMT with polar modifier (MT2EtOH)
- **High-temperature processing** (>220°C compounding) → consider sepiolite or unmodified halloysite instead of OMMT

### 2. What property are you targeting?

- **Gas barrier** → OMMT (high aspect ratio platelets create tortuous path). Nothing else comes close.
- **Mechanical stiffness** → OMMT at 2–5 wt% for maximum effect. Halloysite at 5–10 wt% for easier processing with moderate gains.
- **Flame retardancy** → OMMT as synergist with conventional FR systems
- **Controlled release** → Halloysite (hollow lumen for agent loading)
- **Rheology/thixotropy in aqueous systems** → Na-MMT
- **Rheology in organic/solvent systems** → OMMT or sepiolite

### 3. What is your budget sensitivity?

If cost per kilogram of finished compound matters more than absolute performance, consider that:
- 3 wt% OMMT at $15/kg adds **$0.45/kg** to compound cost
- 7 wt% halloysite at $10/kg adds **$0.70/kg** to compound cost
- 3 wt% Na-MMT at $3/kg adds **$0.09/kg** to compound cost (but only works in compatible systems)

The performance gap between these options may or may not justify the cost difference depending on your application's property thresholds.
