## Glossary of Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **CEC** | **Cation Exchange Capacity** — the total capacity of a clay to exchange cations, measured in milliequivalents per 100 grams (meq/100g). Higher CEC indicates more active exchange sites and greater capacity for organic modification. Na-montmorillonite typically has 80–120 meq/100g. |
| **BET** | **Brunauer-Emmett-Teller** — a method for measuring specific surface area by nitrogen gas adsorption. Reported in m²/g. Higher BET surface area generally correlates with better dispersion potential in polymer matrices. |
| **XRD** | **X-Ray Diffraction** — the primary technique for measuring basal spacing (d-spacing) of layered clays. The d₀₀₁ peak position tells you whether clay is unmodified (~1.2 nm), intercalated (1.8–4 nm), or exfoliated (no peak). |
| **TGA** | **Thermogravimetric Analysis** — measures weight loss as a function of temperature. Used to quantify organic modifier content in organoclays and determine thermal stability onset. |
| **d-spacing** | The interlayer distance between clay platelets, measured by XRD in nanometers. Larger d-spacing indicates successful intercalation or modification. |
| **TRL** | **Technology Readiness Level** — a 1–9 scale measuring maturity of a technology from basic research (TRL 1) to proven in operational environment (TRL 9). |
| **MMT** | **Montmorillonite** — the most widely used nanoclay mineral, a 2:1 layered aluminosilicate belonging to the smectite group. |
| **OMMT** | **Organo-Modified Montmorillonite** — montmorillonite with organic cations (typically quaternary ammonium salts) exchanged into the interlayer, increasing d-spacing and improving compatibility with organic polymers. |
| **Tactoid** | A stack of clay platelets that remain aggregated together. Fewer tactoids and more individual platelets (exfoliation) generally means better performance. |
| **Exfoliation** | Complete separation of individual clay platelets (~1 nm thick) from their stacked arrangement. The gold standard for nanocomposite performance but difficult to achieve completely in practice. |
| **Intercalation** | Insertion of polymer chains or organic molecules between clay platelets, increasing d-spacing but not fully separating the layers. |
| **REACH** | **Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals** — EU regulation governing chemical substances. Nanomaterials may have additional registration requirements. |
| **OTR** | **Oxygen Transmission Rate** — measures barrier performance of films and coatings. Nanoclay addition typically reduces OTR by creating a tortuous path for gas molecules. |
| **Aspect Ratio** | The ratio of platelet diameter to thickness. Higher aspect ratios (>100) improve barrier and mechanical reinforcement. Montmorillonite platelets are typically 1 nm thick and 100–500 nm in diameter. |
